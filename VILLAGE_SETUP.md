# Village Management Functionality

## Overview
This implementation provides a complete village management system for the volunteer application, including:
- Loading villages from database into a dropdown
- Adding new villages dynamically
- Auto-reloading the dropdown after adding new villages
- Proper integration with the volunteer registration form

## Features Implemented

### 1. Page Load â†’ Auto-load Villages
- When the page opens, `loadVillages()` function is automatically called
- Fetches villages from `api/villages.php?fn=list`
- Populates the village dropdown with current data

### 2. Add New Village Button
- "+ Add New Village" button next to the dropdown
- Clicking opens a prompt to enter village name
- Makes API call to `api/villages.php` with `fn=add`
- Saves new village to database

### 3. Auto-reload After Save
- After successfully adding a village, dropdown automatically reloads
- New village is automatically selected in the dropdown
- Updated list shows all villages including the newly added one

## Database Setup

### Create Villages Table
Run the SQL script `create_villages_table.sql` in your database:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `villages` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `village_name` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `created_at` timestamp NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
  UNIQUE KEY `village_name` (`village_name`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
```

### Sample Data
The script also includes sample villages:
- Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai, Kolkata
- Hyderabad, Pune, Ahmedabad, Jaipur, Lucknow

## API Endpoints

### List Villages
```
GET api/villages.php?fn=list
```
Returns: Array of villages with `id` and `village_name`

### Add Village
```
POST api/villages.php
Body: village_name={name}&fn=add
```
Returns: `{"ok": true, "id": {new_id}}` or `{"ok": false, "error": "message"}`

## File Changes Made

### 1. index.php
- Updated village dropdown structure with Bootstrap styling
- Added "+ Add New Village" button
- Implemented `loadVillages()` function
- Implemented `addVillage()` function
- Added event listener for village button
- Auto-load villages on page load
- Reload villages after form submission

### 2. admin/list.php
- Fixed village display to use `village_name` instead of `village`

### 3. api/villages.php
- Already properly implemented with list and add functionality

### 4. api/volunteers.php
- Already properly handles `village_id` field

## Testing

### Test Page
Use `test_villages.html` to test the village functionality:
- Load villages button
- Add new village functionality
- API endpoint testing

### Manual Testing
1. Open `index.php` - villages should auto-load
2. Click "+ Add New Village" button
3. Enter a village name in the prompt
4. Verify village is added and dropdown reloads
5. Verify new village is auto-selected

## Error Handling

- Network errors are caught and displayed to user
- Database errors are returned from API
- Form validation prevents empty village names
- Console logging for debugging

## Browser Compatibility

- Uses modern async/await syntax
- Compatible with all modern browsers
- Graceful fallback for older browsers (with polyfills)

## Security Features

- Input sanitization in PHP backend
- Prepared statements for database queries
- Unique constraint on village names
- Proper error handling without exposing system details
